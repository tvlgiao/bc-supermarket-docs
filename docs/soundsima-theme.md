#### OPTIMIZE FOR EXECUTION TIME

By default, all products will be loaded and displayed when opening the page. At a result, it takes a longer execution time that can affect your site's Page Speed score. To avoid this, you can select **Only load when scrolling to the viewport** option, the products won't loaded until user scrolls down to this area.

#### SPECIFY WHICH CATEGORIES TO DISPLAY

By default, the product categories displayed are the top categories in the order in which they are sorted on the main navigation. You can limit number of categories to display by setting Number of Categories option.

You can manually specify which categories should be displayed by setting the categories ID to Category ID box, separated by comma. For example: 200,221,254,275. Check instruction How to find the category ID. Note that Number of Categories will be ignored if you choose to display categories manually.
