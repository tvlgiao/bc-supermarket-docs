Instant Load can speed up your store dramatically by predict and preload the pages user may view forward. It makes user navigation effectively instant in most cases. Let's preview this feature in this video:

To enable this feature in **Theme Editor** > **Global** > tick on **Enable Instant-Load for faster browsing pages (experiment)**.

Note that this feature only works for certain pages such as: _Category pages_, _product pages_, _brand pages_, _blog_ and _static web pages_. Other pages will be loaded as normal.
