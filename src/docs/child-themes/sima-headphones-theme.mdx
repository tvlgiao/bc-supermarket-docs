### SPECIFY WHICH CATEGORIES TO DISPLAY

By default, the product categories displayed are the top categories in the order in which they are sorted on the main navigation. You can limit number of categories to display by setting Number of Categories option.

You can manually specify which categories should be displayed by setting the categories ID to Category ID box, separated by comma. For example: 200,221,254,275.
